## Current Site Assessment

- **First Contentful Paint:** 836ms
- **Pages:** 4 (Home, Menu, About Us, Contact Us)

  - No photos of restaurant interior or dining experience
  - No explanation of the AYCE concept or pricing structure
  - About Us section reads like auto-generated filler text
  - No customer reviews or testimonials

  - Hours on website differ from Yelp (potential customer confusion)
  - SEO-spam footer with dozens of keyword-stuffed local links

## Brand Identity
- **Primary Color:** #252525 (dark gray/black -- very generic)

- **Logo:** NONE -- text-only name in nav bar
- **Tagline:** "Endless Hibachi & Sushi" (implied from name)
- **Brand Opportunity:** Extremely strong -- they have ZERO brand identity. A premium redesign would be transformative.

- **Address:** Consistent across all sources: 17012 Palm Pointe Dr, Tampa, FL 33647

## Outreach Ammunition
1. **No brand identity at all** -- their current site has zero visual branding, no logo, no color scheme beyond grayscale. A premium branded website would be a massive upgrade.
2. **Multiple locations, single basic website** -- they have 4 locations but the website only mentions one. Huge opportunity for location-specific pages.
3. **AYCE concept not explained** -- their biggest selling point (all-you-can-eat made-to-order, NOT a buffet) is completely absent from the website. New customers have no idea what to expect.
4. **4,200+ reviews but none on their site** -- they have thousands of positive reviews across platforms but display zero on their own website. Social proof is completely missing.
5. **75 Instagram followers** -- minimal social presence despite being a visually appealing food concept. A new site with Instagram integration could drive social growth.
6. **9.8MB page load** -- while the initial load is fast, total transfer is nearly 10MB due to unoptimized Cloudinary images. This hurts mobile users.
7. **SEO spam footer** -- the current site has an obvious keyword-stuffing footer that could hurt Google rankings. A clean, properly optimized site would improve organic search.
8. **14 years in business** -- established business with loyal customer base but a website that looks like it was set up yesterday with a free template.
