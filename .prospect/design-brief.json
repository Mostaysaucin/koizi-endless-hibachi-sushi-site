Deep charcoal and matte black backgrounds let vibrant food photography and warm gold accents command attention. The design evokes the precision and artistry of Japanese cuisine while communicating the generous, celebratory spirit of endless dining. Think: upscale izakaya meets contemporary sushi bar -- not cheap buffet, not stuffy fine dining.",

    "inspiration_notes": "Reference analysis revealed a strong pattern: the best Japanese restaurant sites (Noble Rice, SushiSamba, O-Ku) all use dark backgrounds with warm accent lighting to make food photography pop. Kingdom Sushi (direct AYCE competitor) uses a dark theme with white serif headings -- Koizi should differentiate with warmer gold accents and a more refined Japanese aesthetic rather than Kingdom's modern-generic approach. Noble Rice's Squarespace site uses full-bleed food photography with minimal overlays and a MICHELIN badge prominently featured -- Koizi should use its 2,800+ Google reviews as an equivalent trust signal. SushiSamba uses bold split-screen layouts with video backgrounds -- too heavy for Koizi's needs but the cultural storytelling approach (Japanese + South American roots) inspires how Koizi should tell its own origin story. O-Ku uses clean, minimal layouts with elegant serif typography on dark backgrounds -- this refined simplicity is the right direction for Koizi's Japanese heritage."
